## Reproduce Simulation Experiments 
To reproduce, run python code/Experiment{i}.py. It will print the bias/variance table to stdout.
* Experiment1.py: incentive and no confounder, Result in Table 1
* Experiment2.py: incentive and confounder, Result in Table 2 
* Experiment3.py: no incentive and confounder, Result in Table 3 
* Experiment4.py: no incentive and confounder, Result in Table 4 
* Experiment5.py: incentive and misspecified choice model, Result in Table 5 
## Reproduce Real-data Experiments 
* No-incentive-analysis.py: analyze no-incentive-data, Result in Table 7 
* With-incentive-analysis.py: analyze with-incentive-data, Result in Table 9 
* No-incentive-data.csv: survey data with no incentive condition 
* With-incentive-data.csv: survey data with incentive condition
